In this modern day, urban traffic congestion has been spreading throughout the world due to the population of city and number of vehicles on the road increasing day by day. The need to control the streets, highways and roads cannot be neglected anymore. The main reason behind this problem is the techniques that are used for traffic light control system. Although there are many simpler techniques out there, such using fixed-timer control system. This technique has been proven ineffective as the traffic congestion has still not been reduced.
